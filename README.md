Purpose of the Application:

This application is a GPS for tourists or people who look for new interesting places to have fun. The app provides a GPS service that shows all the local entertainment destinations and gives live recommendations on new establishments and tourist destinations that the city has to offer. It features a bingo like game for the week. Each card represents a location to visit. The GPS can be used offline although with limited use, this lets users get to fun destinations without having to worry about data. 

Design Considerations:

When designing the app, us the development team focused on simple menu designs to make the app both easy to use and navigate. Everything is accessible within 1 to 2 clicks. 

Utilisation of GitHub:

GitHub was used to help connect the members of our group, even though we live far away from one another, we were still able to collaborate on the code through GitHub.
We were also able to use GitHub's built-in actions to create automated tests that ensure that our features work as they are intended to, even if ran on an outside machine.
